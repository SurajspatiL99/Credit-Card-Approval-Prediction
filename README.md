# Credit Card Approval Prediction

This project focuses on credit card approval prediction using machine learning techniques. The goal of the project is to develop a model that can accurately predict whether a credit card application will be approved or not based on various features and attributes of the applicant. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains relevant information for building the prediction model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle at the following link: [Credit Card Approval Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction). It consists of various features such as income, age, employment details, credit history, and more, which are used to predict credit card approval.

## Prerequisites

To run the code and reproduce the credit card approval prediction model, you need the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE of your choice

The following Python libraries are required as well:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

These libraries can be installed using pip with the following command:

```
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download and extract the ZIP file.

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-approval-prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```
cd credit-card-approval-prediction
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook or your preferred Python IDE.

```
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open the `credit-card-approval-prediction.ipynb` file.

5. Execute the code cells in sequential order to run the credit card approval prediction model.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `credit-card-approval-prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and prediction.

- `dataset.csv`: The dataset file downloaded from Kaggle, which is used for building the credit card approval prediction model.

## Analysis Overview

The analysis and model building process include the following steps:

#### 1. Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and convert categorical variables into numerical format.
